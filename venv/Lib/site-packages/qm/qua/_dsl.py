    Create a QUA program.

    Used within a context manager, the program is defined in the code block
    below ``with`` statement.

    Statements in the code block below are played as soon as possible, meaning that an instruction
    will be played immediately unless it is dependent on a previous instruction.
    Additionally, commands output to the same quantum elements will be played sequentially,
    and to different quantum elements will be played in parallel.
    An exception is that pulses will be implicitly aligned at the end of each :func:`for_` loop iteration.

    The generated ``program_name`` object is used as an input to the execute function of a
    :class:`QuantumMachine<qm.QuantumMachine>` object.

    Example of creating a QUA program::

        with program() as program_name:
            play('pulse1', 'element1')
            wait('element1')

       in the configuration of the element, and then sampling

        If ``stream`` is set to ``None``, raw results will not be saved
        (note: must be explicitly set to ``None``).
        The raw results will be saved as long as the digital pulse that is played with pulse is high.

        A parameter specifying the source of the demodulation data, the target variable and the demodulation method.

        By calling either `demod` or `integration` with the member functions `full`, `sliced`, `accumulated` and
